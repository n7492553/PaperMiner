<h2>TROVE</h2>

<p>TROVE is a service provided by <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/" target="_blank">The National Library of Australia</a> which allows the general public to search an
extensive collection of resources using simple key-words, or more sophisticated query constructs. TROVE contains eight (8) "zones", including 
Australian newspapers from the early days of the colony of Australia, up until a date in the 1950's when copyright restrictions apply. To enable
text searching, the articles have been converted to text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This ability of OCR software to correctly
convert images of newspapers to text is largely limited by the quality of the image, and to a lesser extent by the typeface used. The TROVE
designers accept that this process will produce frequent OCR errors ('o' for 'e' is very common), but mitigate the problem by allowing readers
to make corrections the the OCR text and update the stored records. These "crowd-sourced" corrections are immediately made available to all,
gradually improving the quality of the converted text for the benefit of all.</p>

<h2>TROVE API Key</h2>
<p>To further enhance the usability of TROVE, the designers have made available a HTML based Application Programming Interface (API) which allows
the service to be incorporated into systems designed by third parties. As any request/response service which has an API becomes susceptible to
degradation through heavy use, users of the API are required to obtain a "key" which must be passed to TROVE with each request. This allows the
TROVE server to track users and prevent an individual API user from making excessive requests, thus impacting all users. To obtain a TROVE API Key,
create a <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/signup" target="_blank">TROVE User Account</a>, then follow 
<a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/general/api" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.</p>
