<h3 id="t1" class="help-h3">New Features in This Release</h3>
<p>As this is the first general release of <em>Paper Miner</em>, all features are effectively new!
We suggest you review the Help pages to gain an understanding of the capabilities of <em>Paper Miner</em>.

<p>You will notice that some menu choices are for functions not yet implemented. We have left these in rather than hiding
them so users will have some idea of the direction we think <em>Paper Miner</em> development should take. We welcome
your experiences and suggestions (see the Contact pane).

<h3 id="t2" class="help-h3">Defects Fixed in this Release</h3>

<div class="indent">

<h4 id="t21" class="help-h4">Unable to Register or Login on a Tablet</h4>
<p>Users who tried the Beta releases of <em>Paper Miner</em> reported that the dialog used to Login, or Register, was not
always visible after selecting the menu option. This was due to an obscure relative positioning problem that has been fixed.
We include this note so that you know it is safe to go back to your iPad, subject to the restriction(s) noted below.

<h4 id="t22" class="help-h4">The Timeline Sliders don't work in some browsers</h4>
<p>The bug which prevented the timeline markers from being moved when run under Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on MS Windows 7 and 8
has been tracked down to the operating system incorrectly reporting to the browser that machines without touch screens had touch screens!
Perhaps they thought we'd all be using Surface tablets by now. Regardless, Paper Miner should now only enable gesture response on iPads,
and perhaps Android devices.

<h3 id="t3" class="help-h3">Known Restrictions, Bugs and Workarounds in this Release</h3>

<div class="indent">

<h4 id="t31" class="help-h4">Map not fully displayed</h4>
<p>During development, testers noticed that on occasions, most of the map display would turn grey, with only a fragment displayed.
<em>Paper Miner</em> uses Google Maps which builds the display using a matrix of "tiles", downloaded on demand from Google, at
various zoom factors. The "missing tile" problem is a result of the tiles being incorrectly located with negative offsets,
outside the map display. This is a Google Map bug, but due to its highly intermittent nature, the cause is not known, so no
investigation can be made. 

<p>The simple work-around has been to reload <em>Paper Miner</em>, but as this will cause the loss of all records associated with
the current query, a button has been provided on the Map pane to reset the map without loss of TROVE results and any associated Map Markers.
If you suddenly experience lost map tiles, press the <span class="help-button">&nbsp;Refocus map&nbsp;</span> button to restore the
default map display pan and zoom settings.

<h4 id="t32" class="help-h4">Timeline Sliders hard to move on Tablets</h4>
<p>It has been noticed that while the Timeline sliders work well with a mouse, users of gesture based devices such as the Apple iPad and other tablet
computers may experience difficulty dragging the markers to new positions. A cure will be investigated in a future release, but until them,
rotating the display to landscape mode will make sliding the timeline markers easier. You may return to portrait mode after they are repositioned.

<p>Note that <em>Paper Miner</em> was conceived as a desktop application, although where possible, we've tried to make it Tablet Friendly.

<h4 id="t33" class="help-h4">The Wheel Spins, but Nothing Happens</h4>
<p>When TROVE is exceptionally busy, it is possible for a request to timeout in a way that <em>Paper Miner</em> can not currently detect and trap.
This effectively locks up <em>Paper Miner</em> as it waits patiently for something which will never happen. We are looking at possible ways of
detecting and intervening, but right now, if it looks like your query is frozen with the spinning wheel spinning, the only work-around is to
reload <em>Paper Miner</em>.

<h4 id="t34" class="help-h4">No Locations!</h4>
<p>The task of mining TROVE's 300 million articles for locations is time consuming and complicated by external factors beyond our control.
We intend that the job will be completed Real Soon Now, but if your query does not display any location pins, it's probably because we have
not processed the records returned by your query yet. You may wish to toggle the Map Markers to the alternative Publisher locations as a
substitute for now.

<h4 id="t35" class="help-h4">There is text in the Snippet, but the Full Text says "&lt;nil&gt;"</h4>
<p>How the snippet is generated is not known, and instances of the snippet text being more correct, OCR-wise, than the full text are not uncommon.
It appears in some cases that the full text is withheld pending a quality check, while the record itself is released! This a TROVE feature beyond our control.

<h4 id="t36" class="help-h4">The Timeline Sliders don't work in some browsers</h4>
<p>Beta testers have reported that on some combinations of computer hardware, operating system, and web browser of choice, the timeline markers
will not budge. We have been unable to reproduce this problem in any of our test environments, but have seen it demonstrated. A cause and
remedy are a priority for a near future release. Until then, we can only pass on that one user unable to use Chrome, had success with Safari, while
another having problems with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, was able to use the sliders under Opera! Note that no attempt has been made to make 
<em>Paper Miner</em> compatible with any version of Internet Explorer. All development was carried out on an Apple iMac, using Linux servers.
The developers have tested it under Chrome, Firefox, and Safari with no problems, but we welcome your input relating to combinations of
platform and components giving trouble.

<h4 id="t37" class="help-h4">The Sahara is in Africa, not India</h4>
<p>Correctly identifying data mined locations with 100 percent accuracy is impossible, short of artificial intelligence to infer states and
countries from the article context. The problem of "false positives" is compounded by OCR errors which can cause a place name to be identified
against misspelled text, or missed because of name mutilation. Our philosophy is similar to TROVE's: do the best we can and provide tools
for our users to remove and insert locations related to a particular record for the benefit of all.
