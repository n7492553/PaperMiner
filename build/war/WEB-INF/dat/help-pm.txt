<h1>Paper Miner</h1>

<h2 id="h1">Introduction</h2>
<p><em>Paper Miner</em> is a wrapper around the <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/" target="_blank">NLA TROVE service</a>, specifically, the newspaper "zone"
which contains searchable text from Australian newspapers, and the Australian Womens' Weekly. It enhances the basic search results by adding
graphic views which assist users to analyze the masses of data which may be returned by a key-word search. 
At present, these visualization aids are a <em>Timeline</em> depicting the spread of search results by year, and a map which 
displays the location of places mentioned in the search result articles, or the place of publication of the articles. Both employ
colour encoding to represent the frequency of record instances in the result set.</p>

<div class="indent">

<h3 id="h11" class="help-h3">Responsiveness</h3>
<p>The NLA TROVE service processes tens of thousands of requests per hour! At times, the speed of response can be quite slow. At times of heavy load,
it is possible that a TROVE request will timeout and fail completely. Sadly, this is NOT something that <em>Paper Miner</em> can do anything about. 
Please be patient...

<p>We strongly recommend that you read the <a href="#" onClick="showHelp('rel')">Release Notes</a> for the current version which details
any limitations, issues, and work-arounds of which you should be aware.

<h2 id="h2">Menu</h2>
<p>The <em>Paper Miner</em> menu controls query execution, display selection, user management, etc. Although most menu items should be
obvious to the modern computer user, the notes below explain some less obvious features of the service and may save you some time.</p>

 <h3 id="h21" class="help-h3">Query</h3>
 <p>This menu allows user to create and execute queries, examine the progress of the current query, and to save and re-execute queries.</p>
 
 <div class="indent">
 
  <h4 id="h211" class="help-h4">New</h4>
  <p>To create a new query, select <span class="menu-text">Query&#187;New</span>. The New Query pane provides three levels of query, although
  in the present release, only "Simple" queries are supported.</p>
  
  <div class="indent">
  <p><b>Simple</b>: a basic search based on user provided text. This can be a single word, multiple words, and terms enclosed in quotes.
  The search is explicitly directed to the TROVE "newspaper" zone.
  For help composing your query, see the <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/general/newspapers_help" target="_blank">TROVE Newspaper Help page</a>.
  </p>
  </div>
  
  <p>To start your query running, press the <span class="help-button">&nbsp;Execute query&nbsp;</span> button. 
  A "spinner" activity indicator will appear on the top of the screen, to the left of the TROVE Logo
  while query results are being received. The display will switch automatically to the <a href="#h212">Current query</a> pane as soon
  as the first results arrive.
  <em>Paper Miner</em> begins by fetching a small number of results to provide swift feedback on how many records your query might ultimately receive.
  The number of records per request ramps up until the maximum of one hundred is reached. If you change to a different view before the first
  results are received, the automatic switch to the Current query pane is skipped.</p>

  <h4 id="h212" class="help-h4">Current</h4>
  <p>This menu option may be selected at any time to examine the state of the current query being executed, or last one executed. 
  From this display you can pause and resume your query, at will. This display is selected automatically when
  the first results for your query arrive, provided you are still viewing the "New" query view. If you change to another view before the
  first results arrive, the switch to the "Current" view will not take place.</p>
  
  <p>The Current query view allows you to pause and resume your query at any time. The number of records currently fetched, the total 
  number of records that your query has found, and the time the query has spent retrieving records from TROVE are displayed.
  TROVE restricts users of an API Key to a maximum of 100 records per request.
  <p>Paper Miner</em> begins with a small number of records to provide a quick initial response, ramping up over the first few requests
  to the maximum allowable.</p>
  
  <p>If the query is one you may wish to re-run later, you can save the query by (you guessed it) pressing the 
  <span class="help-button">&nbsp;Save query&nbsp;</span> button.
  This takes you to a view which displays all your saved queries and from which you can provide a meaningful name for the query to be saved.
  For convenience, the title defaults to the query term(s), but you can change it to anything you wish. The number of records found when you
  ran the query is also saved and displayed so you can determine if some OCR fix in TROVE has increased the hits on a subsequent run.
  Unfortunately the amount of storage which would be required to determine just what the records involved in a change might be makes
  such a feature impractical.</p>
  
  <p>The <span class="help-button">&nbsp;Revise query&nbsp;</span> button takes you back to the New query pane without clearing the terms
  used previously. This allows you to modify a search without re-entering terms. Note that you will need to pause the
  current search to use this feature.</p>
  
  <h4 id="h213" class="help-h4">Saved</h4>
  <p>As <a href="#h212">described above</a>, <em>Paper Miner</em> provides each user with up to 20 saved queries for convenient re-execution.
  Selecting the <span class="menu-text">Query&#187;Saved</span> displays your queries, allowing you to select one for execution by clicking the
  query description next to the check box. This takes you to the <a href="h211">New query</a> view, allowing you to start it running, or modify the
  query string before execution.</p>
  
  <p>To delete saved queries which are no longer required, tick (click) the check-box to the left of the query description, the press the
  <span class="help-button">&nbsp;Delete Selected&nbsp;</span> button. You may delete more than one query at a time.</p>
  
  <p>A future release of <em>Paper Miner</em> will allow you to schedule periodic re-execution of your stored queries, emailing you the number
  of results found for the new and previous run. You will need to authenticate your email address to use the Stored query feature. This
  process is explained in the <a href="#h23">User menu section</a>.

 </div>

 <h3 id="h22" class="help-h3">View</h3>
 <p>This set of menu options is the real power behind <em>Paper Miner</em>. As wonderful as a list of references to newspaper articles
 may be, reading each to determine its relevance to you is time consuming and tedious, not to mention distracting if you elect to correct the OCR text!
 The View menu provides graphic visualizations of your results, as well as different ways of viewing and sorting the actual results.
 Testing suggests that the sort capability of <em>Paper Miner</em> is significantly faster than requesting sorted results from TROVE itself.</p>
 
 <p>Note that is is not necessary to complete, or pause a query before switching to a View option. You may let the query run in the
 background and view the results graphically, as the arrive.</p>

 <div class="indent">

  <h4 id="h221" class="help-h4">Map</h4>
  <p>The "Map" view provides two separate visualization, geospatial, and temporal. The map displays marker pins denoting either the
  place of publication of results received so far, or the location of place names data mined from the basic TROVE results by the
  <em>Paper Miner</em> researchers, and users. The timeline indicates how the results are distributed by year of publication. The 
  density of results with a year, or for a data mined location are indicated by the colour of the timeline bar, and the the map
  marker pin. The legend to the right of the map explains the colour coding.</p>
  
  <p>To further assist users understand their results, two sliders positioned above the timeline allow the viewer to restrict the
  timeline range for the map markers, and the <a href="#h222">Raw Results</a>. Click and drag a slider to move it. While the mouse
  button is down, a popup will display the year the slider is positioned on. Changes to the map markers occur after the slider
  is released.</p>
  
  <p>The map visualization is further controlled by a pair of radio buttons below the timeline display. Selecting "Place names"
  displays the colour-coded location markers for locations data mined from the results. As there are literally millions
  of TROVE newspaper articles, this data-mining process is performed off-line and stored in a database, matched to the TROVE
  identifiers of the records you retrieve. This means that OCR errors may result in some names being omitted. In other cases,
  ambiguity of a place name may result in it being incorrectly identified. Humans may be able to intelligently identify the
  correct location from the article context; machines have great difficulty. But we have a solution, described in the section
  on <a href="#222">Raw Results</a>, below.</p>
  
  <p>The other radio button, "Publisher", indicates the location of the publisher for all articles currently found by the 
  query which fall within the selected timeline slider positions. No attempt is made currently to colour code publisher
  markers according to frequency in the result set.</p>
  
  <p>If you mouse-over a timeline marker, popup hover-text will indicate the actual year the marker represents. Markers are also
  buttons, so if you click one, the display will change to the <a href="#h222">Raw Results view</a>, showing only the TROVE
  records for that year, in ascending date order.
  
  <h4 id="h222" class="help-h4">Raw Results</h4>
  <p>This view gives a scrolling list of results which may be sorted using the radio buttons at the bottom of the display.
  Clicking an entry in the scrolling list displays the record contents in the detail pane on the right. By default, TROVE
  returns only a "snippet" of the full article text around the occurrence of your search term(s). You may load the full
  text into the detail view using the <span class="help-button">&nbsp;load full text&nbsp;</span> button.</p>
  
  <p>For convenience, a button is provided to enable you to correct OCR errors of a viewed record, on the actual TROVE
  web site. After saving the changes on TROVE, you can press the <span class="help-button">&nbsp;Refresh Record&nbsp;</span> button to update the detail view with
  the changes you have just made.</p>
  
  <p><b>Important!</b> As TROVE provides no harvesting capability (such as <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/" target="_blank">OAI-PMH</a>),
  corrections you make to place names will not result in their magically appearing in <em>Paper Miner</em>. Instead
  we rely on periodic full data dumps and full re-mining of place names. This is a massive undertaking requiring
  super-computer services, so is not undertaken with any great frequency. If TROVE were to implement a simple OAI-PMH
  service, <em>Paper Miner</em> could be kept in sync with TROVE on a daily basis. Until then, we must rely on
  infrequent dump/analyze cycles, and the ability of individual users to edit the locations maintained by <em>Paper Miner</em>
  as <a href="#h2221">described below</a>.</p>
  
  <h4 id="h2221" class="help-h4">Edit Locations</h4>
  <p>The <span class="help-button">&nbsp;Edit Locations&nbsp;</span> button of the <a href="#h222">Raw Results view</a> provides a means for <em>Paper Miner</em> users
  to assist each other by improving the quality of the mined locations of individual TROVE records, much in the same way
  as TROVE itself encourages users to improve the quality of its OCR'd data.</p>
  
  <p>When selected, the user is presented with a view of the TROVE record's text (snippet, plus full text) and a list of
  place names associated with the record, if any. If a location is obviously incorrect&mdash;say Newcastle England,
  when Newcastle Australia is the obvious location from the article context&mdash;the location can be effectively deleted
  by clicking the check-box beside the name and pressing <span class="help-button">&nbsp;Remove location&nbsp;</span>. This marks the location as "struck-through"
  so that future data-mining will not inadvertently put it back!</p>
  
  <p>To add a location, select the place name in the text (double-click a word, or click-drag over the text), then press the
  <span class="help-button">&nbsp;Add Location&nbsp;</span> button. A dialog will appear which allows you to search the <em>Paper Miner</em> database, or the
  <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/" target="_blank">Google Geocode facility</a>.
  <b>Always</b> try the local database before google, as we may already "know" the location, and just need to index it
  against the current TROVE record identifier.</p>
  
  <p>In both cases (local and Google), adding an Australian state abbreviation (eg, Qld), and or a full country name
  (eg, Canada), may help correctly retrieve the required location. You may also edit the place name itself if it has
  been mangled by OCR and not corrected, however we strongly suggest correcting all the OCR text first in TROVE as
  part of the add process is to search the full text to determine how many times the place is mentioned. 
  This will obviously fail if the text contains OCR errors.</p>
  
  <p>If you have found a location for the new place name, press the <span class="help-button">&nbsp;Accept&nbsp;</span> button to complete adding it permanently
  to the public <em>Paper Miner</em> database.</p>

 <h3 id="h23" class="help-h3">User</h3>
 <p>This menu item allows <em>Paper Miner</em> users to log in, register, and maintain their details and options.
 Note that all TROVE queries will be performed using YOUR TROVE API key. <em>Paper Miner</em> itself does not
 have one. This allows all users to execute up to TROVE's per-day query limit.</p>
 
 <div class="indent">
 
  <h4 id="h231" class="help-h4">Login or Register</h4>
  <p>We have taken the view that <em>Paper Miner</em> users are academics and professionals without a malicious bone
  in their bodies, hence no password protection is employed. To register, we require only an email address, or something
  which looks like a valid one, and a valid TROVE API Key (see <a href="" target="_blank">here</a> if you don't know what 
  that means). However we strongly encourage you to use your real email address, and select the option to have it verified.
  This will be done by mailing you an acknowledgment to which you respond by clicking a link. Doing this unlocks all of
  the <em>Paper Miner</em> options. Registered users may simply provide their email address to begin using the services.
  The "logged in" state is cookie based, so closing your browser will log you out, as will selecting the Logout option.</p>

  <h4 id="h232" class="help-h4">Manage your Details</h4>
  <p>This menu item allows you to change your email address, change your TROVE API Key, or request your email be verified.
  A future release may extend the user details to cover various preference settings.</p>
